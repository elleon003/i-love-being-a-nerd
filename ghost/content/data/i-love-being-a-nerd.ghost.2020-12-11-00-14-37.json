Rather\nthan giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just\nlet you write code.\n\nMarketplace\nThere are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can\ndownload from the Ghost Theme Marketplace [https://ghost.org/marketplace/]:\n\nAnyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme with some solid knowledge of\nHTML and CSSTheme development\nGhost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has\na set of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. For example: \n{{author.name}} outputs the name of the current author.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at \nthe\nsource code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily\ncommented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.\n\n\n * default.hbs is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this\n   file unless specifically told to use a different template.\n * post.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing a post.\n * index.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.\n * and so on\n\nWe've got full and extensive theme documentation\n[https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/] which outlines every template\nfile, context and helper that you can use. You can also get started with our\nuseful starter theme [https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter/], which includes the\nmost common foundations and components required to build your own theme.\n\n> If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a themes section on our public Ghost forum\n[https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes].","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2020-12-10 02:40:24","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-12-10 02:40:24","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2020-12-10 02:40:24","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme designed for publishers which can easily be adapted for most purposes, or you can build a custom theme to suit your needs.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5fd18a98d49c5b1abd321e36","uuid":"4f3ad03d-d700-49bd-ab07-d5cd2fac6b95","title":"Apps & integrations","slug":"apps-integrations","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-icons.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"full\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<script src=\\\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8\\\"></script>\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-and-webhooks-in-ghost.png\",\"alt\":\"Screenshot of custom integrations with webhooks in Ghost Admin\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://zapier.com\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/docs/api/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/themes/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Work with your existing tools\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to connect your Ghost site to hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations that take no more than a few minutes to setup.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Whether you need to automate workflows, connect your email list, build a community or embed products from your ecommerce store, our \"],[0,[0],1,\"integrations library\"],[0,[],0,\" has got it all covered with hundreds of tutorials.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On top of this, you can connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external services using the official integration with \"],[0,[1],1,\"Zapier\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[2],1,\"Example\"],[0,[],0,\": When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2],1,\"Here are the most popular Ghost<>Zapier automation templates:\"],[0,[],0,\" \"]]],[10,1],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Custom integrations\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"At the heart of Ghost sits a robust JSON API – designed to create, manage and retrieve content with ease. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys and webhooks from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin. \"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Beyond that, the API allows you to build entirely custom publishing apps.

Or use\nMarkdown shortcuts to do the work for you - if that's your thing. \n\nRich editing at your fingertips\nThe editor can also handle rich media objects, called cards, which can be\norganised and re-ordered using drag and drop. \n\nYou can insert a card either by clicking the+ button, or typing/ on a new line\nto search for a particular card. This allows you to efficiently insert images, \nmarkdown, html, embeds and more.\n\nFor example:\n\n * Insert a video from YouTube directly by pasting the URL\n * Create unique content like buttons or forms using the HTML card\n * Need to share some code? Embed code blocks directly \n\n<header class=\"site-header outer\">\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n        {{> \"site-nav\"}}\n    </div>\n</header>\n\nIt's also possible to share links from across the web in a visual way using\nbookmark cards that automatically render information from a websites meta data.\nPaste any URL to try it out: \n\nGhost: The #1 open source headless Node.js CMSThe world’s most popular modern\nopen source publishing platform.
